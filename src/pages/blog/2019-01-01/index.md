> Hello, friend. "Hello, friend". That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It's actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person.

This is my first post in my new blog. I choose above quote of mr robot show for say hello because I love this show & when I watch first time its first episode this early dialogue and Elliot's personality made me interested in watching this show. I wanna share my ideas, experience, my everyday things here :)
