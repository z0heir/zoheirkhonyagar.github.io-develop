> Hello, friend. "Hello, friend". That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name, but that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It's actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person.
``` "Mr. Robot - S01 E01" ``` 

This is my first post on **[my new blog](https://zoheir.me)**. I choose above quote of Mr. Robot tv series to say hello because I love this show & when I watch its first episode this early dialogue and Elliot's personality made me interested in watching this show.

I wanna share my ideas, experiences, everyday stories here , I do this before on **[previous blog](http://awebdeveloper.blog.ir)**. About a year has passed since the last thing I posted on previous blog. In the last year, I've faced many challenges in my personal life, and finally achieved stability. I worked as a freelancer for a while. About four months ago, I joined **[Vakavic](https://vakavic.com)** company as a Back-End developer. I'll write a separate post about Vakavic and how I joined this company.  

Welcome, my friend. I hope you find my posts helpful :)
